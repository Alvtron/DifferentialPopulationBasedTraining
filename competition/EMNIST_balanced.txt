N = 20 individuals are employed,
within G = 100 generations and the ready-function triggers every 317 iterations,
which results in ≈40 epochs for with batch size of 128.

We implemented the PBT algorithm in Python 3 with PyTorch as our deep learning backend.
Our experiments ran on a DGX-1,
whereby each EA employs its population on 2 (MNIST-like) or 4 (balanced EMNIST) Volta NVIDIA GPUs
with 14 GB VRAM each and either 20 (MNIST-like) or 40 (balanced EMNIST) Intel Xeon E5-2698 CPUs.
