-- Why LSHADE could be better than SHADE and DE

For DE and SHADE, for a given search space that has multiple local minimas, bad performing members can get
stuck in a bad local minima and disturb the other members heading towards the global minima.

LSHADE helps prevent this by iteratively discarding bad performing members.
This is sadly no guarantee that bad members are not throwing good candidates out of course.

-- Why SHADE/LSHADE could be better than DE

SHADE automatically adjusts the F and Cr parameter. With DE, we would have to manually adjust it before each training session.
For problems where there are one ore more local minimas, a small Cr and F would lead to less exploration and shorter exploration,
meaning the local minima might never be escaped. If SHADE eventually generate a higher Cr and F, the local minima might be escaped,
and the bad member could become a good member as well as pass on better genetics to the rest of the population.
